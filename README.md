Install Guide
=============

1. Install or clone this directory into `~/.vim`

2. Configure plugins in ~/.vim/config/vundle.vim
   Most plugins will work out of the box, but some need additional steps
   (e.g. complied components).

3. Run :PluginInstall inside of vim to install the plugins

Enjoy!
