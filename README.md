Install Guide
=============

1. Install or clone this directory into `~/.vim`

2. Install vundle: `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

3. Configure plugins in ~/.vim/config/vundle.vim
   Most plugins will work out of the box, but some need additional steps
   (e.g. complied components).

4. Run :PluginInstall inside of vim to install the plugins

Enjoy!
